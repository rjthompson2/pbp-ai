# pbp-ai

My ultimate goal for this project is to create an ai that can identify football players, formations, and ultimately the individual plays run.

To do this I will start with creating an event-driven software architecture. I woud like to convert my raspberry pi from my Computer Architecture course into a server which tracks nfl games and sends out events to record the games.

After a game is recorded, I will send another event for AI to try to identify players and record stats like snap %, targets, etc.
